abstract = {First-order Gödel logics are a family of finite- or infinite-valued logics where the sets of truth values V are closed subsets of [0,1] containing both 0 and 1. Different such sets V in general determine different Gödel logics GV (sets of those formulas which evaluate to 1 in every interpretation into V). It is shown that GV is axiomatizable iff V is finite, V is uncountable with 0 isolated in V, or every neighborhood of 0 in V is uncountable. Complete axiomatizations for each of these cases are given. The r.e. prenex, negation-free, and existential fragments of all first-order Gödel logics are also characterized.}

keywords = {Machine learning, Neuro-symbolic, Differentiable logic, Verification},
abstract = {Extensive research on formal verification of machine learning systems indicates that learning from data alone often fails to capture underlying background knowledge, such as specifications implicitly available in the data. Various neural network verifiers have been developed to ensure that a machine-learnt model satisfies correctness and safety properties; however, they typically assume a trained network with fixed weights. A promising approach for creating machine learning models that inherently satisfy constraints after training is to encode background knowledge as explicit logical constraints that guide the learning process via so-called differentiable logics. In this paper, we experimentally compare and evaluate various logics from the literature, present our findings, and highlight open problems for future work. We evaluate differentiable logics with respect to their suitability in training, and use a neural network verifier to check their ability to establish formal guarantees. The complete source code for our experiments is available as an easy-to-use framework for training with differentiable logics at https://github.com/tflinkow/comparing-differentiable-logics.}
