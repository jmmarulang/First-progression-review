About the files
---------------

- The README.pdf guide includes a helpful introduction to LaTeX, as well as instructions on installing the template outside of Overleaf, and rebuilding the class files. If you wish to install the Southampton LaTeX templates, please download the original source from https://git.soton.ac.uk/el7g15/uos-latex-template.

- The usodocs.pdf document provides detailed information on the implementation of the UOS templates.

- The main LaTeX document is Thesis.tex. This document makes use of the uosthesis class provided by the uosthesis.cls file. 

- Definitions.tex provides additional LaTeX commands that may be used.

- It is recommended that you use additional .tex files for each chapter and appendix. Thesis.tex shows this with the examples of Introduction.tex, Conclusions.tex, and AppendixA.tex. Use or omit these files as appropriate, and add your own as needed by following those examples.

- Images for figures may be placed in the Figures folder, and included in the document as shown in the examples.

- UOS.bib provides an example bibliography file which can be modified. Thesis.tex is configured to use natbib.
